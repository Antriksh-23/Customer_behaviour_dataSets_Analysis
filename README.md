# Project Title

## Introduction  
This project is an end-to-end data analytics workflow built to extract business insights from a real-world dataset. It begins by loading raw data in Python, explores and cleans the data, then performs SQL-based analysis on a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server). The insights are visualized in an interactive **Power BI** dashboard. 

The goal is to demonstrate data wrangling, analysis, visualization, and communication skills in a way that's both technically rigorous and recruiter-friendly.

## Features  
- Load and preprocess raw data using Python (pandas, NumPy)  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with statistical summaries and visualizations  
- Clean and transform data: handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize data  
- Store and query data using SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)  
- Write SQL queries to answer business questions, compute aggregates, and build views  
- Build a **Power BI** dashboard for interactive visualization (charts, filters, slicers)  
- Create a detailed report capturing methodology, insights, and recommendations

## Usage  
1. **Exploratory Analysis & Cleaning**  
   - Run the Python notebooks to perform EDA and clean the data.  
   - Review summary statistics, charts, and understand data quality issues.  
2. **Database Analysis**  
   - Load cleaned data into your SQL database.  
   - Execute SQL scripts (provided) to create tables / views and query for insights.  
3. **Dashboard Exploration**  
   - Open the Power BI dashboard file (`.pbix`).  
   - Connect it to your data source (database or CSV).  
   - Use interactive filters to explore different dimensions of the data (time, category, region, etc.).  
4. **Reporting & Presentation**  
   - Read through the written report for detailed methodology, visualizations, and business recommendations.  
   - Use the Gamma presentation to present key insights to stakeholders in a clean, narrative-driven way.
